# Tsm_Proposed_methods
Solving TSM problem using different solving methods!

In this repository , We attempt to slove TSP , a toy problem , using new methods including PMX operator as cross-over function and 
Displacement Mutation operator.
Also we impelemented two different cross-over operators which you can see in the cross_over.py.

The results were so promising and we were so close to the best solution (20 <= Gens <= 50).
